Costello   The pitcher's name? 
Abbott     Yes! 
Costello   If I mentioned the third baseman's name, who did I say is playing third? 
Abbott     What? 
Costello   Who's wife? 
Abbott     Who 
Costello   I throw it to I Don't Know. I Don't Know. I Don't Know. I Don't Know throws it to who? 
Abbott     Naturally 
Costello   I'm only asking you, who's the guy runs to second. Who picks up the first baseman, how does he sign his name?
Abbott & Costello Together   Third base!
